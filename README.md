# Playground

A personal repository for experimenting with various programming languages and frameworks.

## Description

This repository serves as a space for me to practice and learn different programming languages and frameworks. I'll be adding code snippets, small projects, and exercises as I explore various technologies.

Currently exploring: Go, Java, TypeScript, Dart, and more.

My goal is to gain a broad understanding of software development and build a portfolio of diverse projects.

## Directory Structure

* `go/`: Go language experiments.
* `java/`: Java language projects.
* `typescript/`: TypeScript code and examples.
* `dart/`: Dart and Flutter explorations.
* `other/`: For other languages and frameworks.
